## Simulation Lab 2
In this lab you will continue to develop your sandbox application. You should create the SimulationSandBox project in the same solution as your SimulationLibrary and testing project. The purpose of the sandbox application is to provide you with the ability to set up scenarios to visually test your simulation library. Your sandbox application should be able to easily load different simulations to demonstrate different effects.
